yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

## Tech

In addition to leveraging the power of the Quasar Framework, it also uses the FontAwesome icon set and FeathersJS Client library to connect to the Feathers Backend server. It is currently compiled and deployed as an SPA with the server on Digital Ocean.
