                As part of the Blokii Ecosystem, this tool allows writers to
                create consistent brand images and easily generate
                technology-branded images. It provides a quick and easy way to
                overlay titles, subtitles, authors, and technology icons onto
                the image to create a blog post.
              </p>
              <p class="text-body-1">
                Current planned features include new templates, using brand
                images instead of default icons, saving image settings to an
                account (and much more once accounts are implemented).
              </p>

                If you have any feature requests, send me a message. I'm working
                on triaging features based on interest, so if you want your
                voice to be heard, tell me what you find useful and would like
                to see in the next release. I'm also working on providing a
                transparent product roadmap for users to see what's upcoming, as
                well as an option to vote on features.
              </p>

                I'm working on this in my free time, so if you find this useful,
                please consider supporting me.
