# Blokii Image Maker

The Blokii Image Maker is built with the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev).

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).

## Tech

In addition to leveraging the power of the Quasar Framework, it also uses the FontAwesome icon set and FeathersJS Client library to connect to the Feathers Backend server. It uses a Fontawesome Pro License, which is domain restricted and only works on certain domains.
